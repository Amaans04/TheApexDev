 TheApexDev Website â€“ Replit Prompt
I'm building the official website for my web development agency called TheApexDev.

Hereâ€™s exactly what I want:

âœ¨ Vision & Theme
The website must feel futuristic, professional, and sleek, as we are a web development agency.

It should match the color palette of the logo I've provided â€” use deep violet (#5e3f94) as the base and gradient tones of pink to soft gray for highlights.

Use the logo as the brand identity guide.

Smooth, elegant page transitions and scroll animations are essential (using Framer Motion or GSAP).

Consider subtle 3D animations or a hero section with Three.js background animation (like orbiting particles or floating elements).

Website must feel high-end, cutting-edge, and developer-crafted.

ðŸ§± Tech Stack
Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Animations: Framer Motion and optionally Three.js

Typography: Use premium fonts with clean, modern headings and high readability for body text (example: Outfit, Poppins, Inter, or Satoshi)
